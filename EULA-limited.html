<p>For the purposes of this agreement, “pay-to-win” features (i.e., those that grant players an in-game competitive advantage through monetary transactions) are permitted under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ethical Monetization Only:</strong><br>Pay-to-win elements are allowed provided they are implemented solely to cover server operational costs and not for generating excess profit. Any revenue collected through these features must be reinvested exclusively to maintain and improve the server rather than to produce financial gain beyond sustaining the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fair Access:</strong><br>The monetization system must be structured so that all players have the opportunity to access these gameplay-affecting features. If a pay-to-win option is offered, there should be alternative means for players to obtain the same or equivalent benefits (e.g., through in-game progress or ethical donation schemes), ensuring that no player is forced to spend money to enjoy the core aspects of the game.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transparency and Compliance:</strong><br>All terms related to any pay-to-win elements must be clearly communicated to users. The monetization practices must be ethical, transparent, and in compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. The intent is to support the sustainability of the server rather than to exploit the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> This clause is provided as a framework for ethical monetization. It is not a substitute for legal advice, and you are advised to have a qualified attorney review your final EULA document to ensure full compliance with applicable laws and policies—including any evolving standards regarding in-game monetization.</p>
